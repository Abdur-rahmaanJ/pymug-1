# Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

Here are my slides (in a jupyter notebook with RISE) and a beginning of a practical analysis of the diabetes dataset provided with scikit-learn.

In order to install all depenencies for the talk, you can either use `pipenv` by running

```bash
pipenv install
```

in the project directory or, if you prefer `pip`, using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You might need to install some jupyter extensions for the slides to work, by running
```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```
if you don't have ipywidgets installed yet.
